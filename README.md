# Meat-consumption-per-capita
The primary objective of this dataset is to analyze the consumption of meat and fish across different entities in relation with their per capita income levels. It aims at providing insight on it consumption pattern, comparative analysis, and policy.
When working with the data set, i had some challenges of grouping and plotting of data because it consist of different years which could not give a perfect graph. The data was gotten from kaggle and it from the year 1961-2021(60 years), it consist of 8 columns and a range of 10080 rows. In the process of analyzing the dataset, i uploaded the dataset using pd.read_csv to convert my csv file to a pandas data frame, check basic information, get basic summary statistics and check for missing values which i came across some missing valuse in beef column(1), pork(288), other meats(7) and  I was able to use the mean of each column and .fillna to fill in missing values and was able to fill them all up, after which i checked if i was able to successfully fill the missing values.
